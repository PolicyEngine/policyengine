# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), 
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

This repo consists of two packages - the React client and the Python server. A change to either repo should trigger an update in the versions for both to ensure a consistent changelog in this repo.

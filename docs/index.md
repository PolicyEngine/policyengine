# PolicyEngine

This documentation contains guidance on developing the PolicyEngine web app for contributors. The [repo](https://github.com/PolicyEngine/PolicyEngine) is available on GitHub.

The app is composed of two parts: the client (a React app in JavaScript) and the server (a Flask app in Python). The client app defines how PolicyEngine looks and behaves in response to the user's actions (for example, the layout, or how the user can input and receive data), and the client app handles the calculations and data storage needed (for example, calculating reform effects, simulating current policy).

The [Client](/client/index.md) and [Server](/server/index.md) sections of this documentation contain more detailed information on the client and server parts of the app, and how to approach developing each.
